python-ddcci
============

Control DDC/CI-capable display using python-smbus.

Keep in mind this is mostly a POC, not a full-blown DDC/CI interface. (however
everything you need to change different settings is already implemented here)

You may find `ddccontrol-db` and `ddccontrol -p` helpful when looking for control
addresses.
